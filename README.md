Creating a custom Linux command involves several steps, but I'll guide you through it.

Firstly, let's create the bash script for your internsctl command. You'll need to have a basic understanding of bash scripting for this task. Here's a template you can start with:

Manual page (man): To create a manual page for your command, you'll need to write a man page in the appropriate format (usually troff or groff format). This requires creating a separate file, such as internsctl.1, and placing it in the appropriate location on your system (often /usr/share/man/man1/). The man page includes a detailed description of the command's usage, options, and examples.

Help (--help): The show_help() function in the script provides basic usage information and a list of available options. You can expand this function to include more detailed examples and usage scenarios for your command.

Version (--version): The show_version() function simply outputs the command's version.

For creating a proper man page and integrating it into your system, you might want to look into man page formatting and how to install custom man pages in your Linux distribution.

Remember to make the bash script executable using the command chmod +x internsctl after saving it in a file named internsctl.

This is a basic starting point, and you can expand upon it by adding more functionality and options as needed.

For a comprehensive man page, I recommend referring to existing man pages (man ls, for example) to understand the format and details included.

License This script is licensed under [LICENSE], allowing for personal and commercial use.

For more information or usage examples, refer to the provided script (myscript.sh) or the man page (myscript.1).

You can replace [LICENSE] with the specific license you choose for your script. Additionally, consider adding more details or customization based on your preferences or specific usage instructions for your script.

Manual Page A manual page (man page) named myscript.1 has been provided in troff format to detail the usage and options of the script. To access it, use man myscript.

Contributions Contributions or suggestions to enhance the script's functionalities or improve documentation are welcome. Feel free to create pull requests or issues.
